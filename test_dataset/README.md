uploaded database. 
It contains : 
1) configuration files : 
  database.ini : contains the MYSQL username, MYSQL password, database name and the name of the host (either localhost or IP address of the computer)
  web.ini : contains the IP address and port of the web application from which the nextJS web application
                                                   be launched. 
2) genomic files of three isolates of Phytophthora melonis. It includes three types of files:
  genomic fasta files 
  genomic gff3 files
  eggnog emapper annotated files. 
Currently the genomic files are hosted in a Google Drive link (since GitHub does not allow a user to host files larger than 25MB):
